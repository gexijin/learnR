# Preface{-}
Targeted at absolute beginners, this book is written based on the philosophy that people learn best through examples. Rather than delving into complex rules, this book focuses on analyzing various datasets from the very beginning. This approach offers an alternative to the traditional, more rigorous R programming textbooks. We begin with small, tidy datasets and gradually move on to larger, messier ones. With each dataset, our goal is to craft a story through analysis. We invite you, our intrepid reader, to join us on this journey. Motivated readers, including biologists, can navigate the book effectively and independently. I strongly encourage you to type in the example code, examine the outputs, and then tackle the challenges and exercises.

Originally, this book was started with the material in first several chapters, which were designed for 2-hour hands-on workshops, providing a swift introduction/demonstration for students and researchers new to R. These workshops have been conducted multiple times, serving diverse audiences, including high-school students and mathematicians. Given the constraints of a 2-hour session, we prioritize keeping it use-friendly, interactive, and enjoyable, sometimes at the expense of strict rigor. Rather than dwelling on all the rules, grammar, and syntax, we found it more effective to focus on a single dataset and guide participants through various possible analyses using R. These materials later evolved into a one-credit online class and then a three-credit course. Throughout, we maintain our unconventional focus on datasets and practical examples. 

Another distinctive feature of this book is our review of the underlying statistical concepts. R serves as a language for statistical computing, making it inseparable from its statistical context.

If you are new to coding, think of it as drafting a recipe. Your objective is to offer precise, step-by-step instructions that even a 10-year-old can use to transform raw ingredients (data) into delicious pasta (results). Just as a good recipe should be followed repeatedly to make pasta with the same ingredients, computer programs can process data with the exact specifications, much like how millions of people share their code on repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The R programming environment is like a wonderful kitchen. It’s free, powerful, interactive, and beginner friendly. In this kitchen, you can find many tools (akin to knives) and complex appliances (similar to stoves); in R, we call them functions, created by others (sometimes painstakingly over many years) and ready to be harnessed for data processing. Just as we must familiarize ourselves with kitchen knives, it's imperative to acquaint ourselves with commonly used R functions. However, just like people rarely read instruction manual foreach kitchen tool, most people learn R functions from example codes provided by others on sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you want to make a veggie smoothie, the recipe requires a fancy blender. You can conveniently go to a marketplace such as [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) to buy one. Similarly, in the realm of the R programming language, you can conveniently download additional R packages from [The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/), a FREE marketplace where tens of thousands of people contribute. The open and collaborative user community is uniquely productive. People build upon one another’s work, continually enhancing functionality while preserving simplicity. There are R packages that can help you create complex charts, write a book (like this one), host a website, or even find a girlfriend (just kidding). Imagine a free appliance that can turn uncooked chicken, vegetables, oil, and spices into delicious Kung Pao Chicken! That is precisely how I feel every time I employ other people’s R packages to analyze genomic data.

In your kitchen, you also find jars, dishes, salt dispensers, pots, and so on; each serves a distinct purpose for different ingredients or foods. Even though some containers are only needed to store intermediate products, it is essential to know what kind of containers there are before starting to cook. Similarly, in programming, we encounter different pre-defined data types. A scalar variable can hold a single number, some text(strings), or a true/false indicator (logical values). A vector contains a sequence of scalars of the same kind. Resembling an Excel spreadsheet with rows and columns, a data frame can be visualized as multiple vectors of the same length. In computer programming, it’s crucial to familiarize ourselves with these data structures. Common R data structures include scalars, vectors, matrices, data frames, and lists.

In my early cooking endeavors, I was always frustrated when people or recipes used vague terms like “a little” olive oil, as seen in this recipe in the picture above. Without any experience, I had no idea whether that meant one drip, a teaspoon, or 1 cup of olive oil! Likewise, a 10-year-old, the target audience for our receipt, might not even understand how small “small pieces” are or even recognize what “boiling water” looks like. Computers are essentially machines that perform calculations faithfully and fast, devoid of any common sense, unlike the human “computers” in history who could calculate, either mentally or with mechanical calculators. In programming, two key principle must be upheld: (1) provide precise, specific step-by-step commands at each step and (2) define the correct sequence of operations, accounting for exceptions such as data being zero or missing.

Just like composing a recipe, the process of programming can be frustrating. Patience and trial-and-error remain the only solutions. Imagine you’ve asked your 6-year-old baby sister to help peeling the carrots. Before moving on to the chopping step, you should inspect the carrots to ensure they have been appropriately peeled. In debugging, one of the primary strategies is to pause and review the intermediate products. The previous steps may not be executed correctly, even though you believe your instructions are clear and accurate. Sometimes typos creep into the code or the correct inputs are omitted. In such cases, printing out the data for a closer look is invaluable. If the data is large, we might examine the first few rows or even just the dimensions(number of rows and columns). The intermediate data objects are created in the computer memory as you execute your code. The coding process involves the step-by-step creation and modification of data objects in memory.

Many students, including the authors, have contributed to  this book. Special recognition goes to Quazi Irfan, who worked as a teaching assistant, fixed many errors, and provided constructive feedback. In the fall of 2018, a group of highly motivated students in the STAT 442 Exploratory Data Analysis worked on some of the datasets presented in this book. We owe gratitude to Samuel Ivanecky, Kory Heier, Audrey Bunge, Jacie McDonald, Shae Olson, Nathan Thirsten, and Alex Wieseler for inspiring some of the plots.

The most effective way to master R is by using it actively, much like learning a foreign language. After the initial first two chapters, you will be well-equipped to start working on your own datasets without needing to master everything in advance. In fact, it’s nearly impossible, as the R community produces extremely useful and cool packages every day. There is no obligation to finish all the chapters of this book. Feel free to search for and borrow example code. Even programmers with 20 years of experience acknowledged that they still google basic functions daily. If you do not have a dataset of your own, you can source one from platforms such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 

Chapter 3 delves into more traditional R programming content, explaining data objects and common functions. If you are self-learning, there is no need to feel guilty about skipping it. You can expedite your progress by swiftly going through the later chapters of the book. There is no need to memorize the functions; instead, focus on understanding their utility. It's worth mentioning that many students, even the authors themselves, keep revisiting the later chapters to recall how a particular plot is generated. Once you go through this book, you can use it as a reference resource.

This book is still a work in progress. The later chapters need to be extensively edited, particularly. We welcome any comments and suggestions to enhance this draft, be it typos, errors, or organizational issues.
