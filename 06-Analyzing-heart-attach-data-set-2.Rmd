# The heart attack dataset (II)

In this chapter, we continue to investigate the heart attack dataset. First, let’s read in the data again and transform several variables into factors like in the previous chapter. Remember, you must set the working directory to where the data file is stored on your computer. Better yet, define a project associated with a folder, it's like giving your data a cozy home.
```{r}
# Set working directory. Skip if using a project.
#setwd("C:/YourPathHere")  
df <- read.table("datasets/heartatk4R.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE)  # Ta-da! Data read
# Convert DRG, DIED, DIAGNOSIS, and SEX into factor
df$DRG <- as.factor(df$DRG)
df$DIED <- as.factor(df$DIED)
df$DIAGNOSIS <- as.factor(df$DIAGNOSIS)
df$SEX <- as.factor(df$SEX)
str(df)  # Double check to make sure everything looks good
```

## Scatter plot in ggplot2
Did you know Hadley Wickham, our ggplot2 superhero, inspired by Leland Wilkinson’s "grammar of graphics", wrote the ggplot2 package in 2005 providing a formal, structured way of visualizing data? Just like how R was originally written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka in the 1990s; Linux was developed by Linus Torvalds, a student, at the same period. A few superheroes can make computing much easier for millions of people. ggplot2 revolutionized data visualization in R.

```{r fig.keep='none'}
library(ggplot2)  # Load the package
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES))  # Specify data frame and aesthetic mapping
```

This line is just the opening act, setting the scene. It specifies the name of the data frame, which is the required input data type, and defines the so-called **aesthetic mapping**: LOS maps to x-axis while CHARGES maps to the y-axis. To bring the plot to life, we use the geom_point function to add data points, which is called **geometric objects**. 
```{r fig.keep='none', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES)) + geom_point()   # Scatter plot
```

Thus, it is a two-step process to generate a scatter plot. Initially, it may feel cumbersome with too many steps, but it is super handy to add additional features or customize the plot step by step.  Let’s add a trend line with a confidence interval for good measure.
```{r fig.keep='none', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = lm)
```

As we keep adding elements to the plot, this line of code gets longer. To keep it reader-friendly, let's split it into multiple lines as below. The “+” at the end of the line signifies that the plot is not finished yet and tell R to keep reading the next line. I often use the tab key in the second line to remind myself that it is continued from the above line. 
```{r fig.keep='none',warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES)) +  # Set aesthetic mapping
	     geom_point() +                # Add data points    
       stat_smooth(method = lm)          # Add trend line
```

As you have seen from this code, it not only makes the code easier reading but also allows room for side comments for each step - a lifesaver when recycling code.

Let's customize the plot by adding additional lines of code (Figure \@ref(fig:15-1)):

(ref:15-1) Scatter plot using ggplot2.

```{r 15-1, message=FALSE, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:15-1)', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES)) +                 # Set aesthetic mapping
       geom_point() +                                   # Add data points    
       stat_smooth(method = lm) +                       # Add trend line
       xlim(0, 25) +         		                 # Adjust plot limits of x-axis 
       labs(x = "Length of stay", y = "Charges ($)") +  # Change x and y labels
       annotate("text", x = 3, y = 45000, label = ("R = 0.74"))  # Add text to plot coordinates
```

For more customization ideas, a simple Google search can be your guide. For example, add title to the plot by using keyword “ggplot2 add title to plot”. It is easy for ggplot2 to represent other characteristics using additional aesthetic mappings, such as linetype, color, size, fill (“inside” color). 
```{r fig.keep='none', warning=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES)) + geom_point()               # Create basic scatter plot
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES, color = DRG)) + geom_point()  # Map DRG to color
```

(ref:15-2) Changing color and shape to represent multivariate data in ggplot2.

```{r 15-2, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, warning=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:15-2)', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, y = CHARGES, color = DRG, shape = SEX)) +  # Map SEX to shape
       geom_point()
```

Each step lets us reveal additional information about these patients (Figure \@ref(fig:15-2)). With ggplot2, we can visualize complex, multivariate data by mapping different columns into diverse types of aesthetics. Figure \@ref(fig:15-1) shows a strong positive correlation between charges and length of hospital stay, which is expected as many itemized costs are billed daily. Note there are over 12,000 data points, many are plotted near or exactly at the same places, especially at the lower left corner. To decode this density, try stat_density2d().

When saving these masterpieces, remember that vector formats (like **metafile**) offer high resolution but can be hefty in size. If you have many such plots in a paper or thesis, your file size can be big. Consider the **bitmap** format for a lightweight alternative.

## Histograms and density plots
In addition to data points(geom_points), there are many other **geometric objects**, such as histogram(geom_histogram), lines (geom_line), bars (geom_bar), and so on. We can use these geometric objects to generate different types of plots.
Let's start with a histogram:
```{r fig.keep='none', message=FALSE}
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next, let's refine it by adding a density curve (Figure \@ref(fig:15-3)):

(ref:15-3) Histogram with density curve.

```{r 15-3, warning=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, message=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:15-3)', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE, y = ..density..)) + 
       geom_histogram(fill = "cornsilk", 
                      colour = "grey60", size = .2) +
       geom_density()
```

Combined density plots are useful in comparing the distribution of subgroups of data points. Start with a plot for all:
```{r fig.keep='none'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)  # A density plot for all
```

Add a splash of color to differentiate sex:
```{r fig.keep='none'} 
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE, color = SEX)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)  # Figure 6.4A
```

Here, we split the dataset by gender, and plotted the density distribution on the same plot. Figure \@ref(fig:15-4)A shows that age distributions are very different between men and women. Women skew rightward, averaging over a decade older than men.  This is surprising, given that this dataset contains all heart attack admissions in New York state in 1993. 

The fill mapping changes the “inside” color:
```{r fig.keep='none'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE, fill = SEX)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3)  # Figure 6.4B
```

This plot shows the same information. But it looks nicer, at least to me. We can also **split the plot into multiple facets** for even more depth:
```{r fig.keep='none'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = AGE, fill = SEX)) + 
       geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + facet_grid(DRG ~.)  # Figure 6.4C
```

(ref:15-4) The art of density plots.

```{r 15-4, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:15-4)', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/img1504_density.png")
```

Recall: DRG=121 represents patients who survived but developed complications; DRG=122 denotes those without complications and DRG=123 are patients who did not survive.  Figure \@ref(fig:15-4)C indicates that women in all three groups are older than men. A closer look at the male patients' age distribution across DRG facets suggests that the distribution skews to the right in deceased patients (DRG=123), indicating that older patients are less likely to survive a heart attack. Also, survivors without complications (DRG= 122) tend to be younger than those with complications.

```

ggplot(df, aes(x = LOS, fill = DRG)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.3) + 
       facet_grid(SEX ~ .) + xlim(0, 20)
```

## Box plots and Violin plots

In the symphony of ggplot2, boxplots and violin plots are like the string instruments - each offering a unique way to play out the data. 
We can follow the same rule of **geometric objects** to generate boxplots using geom_boxplot(), and violin plots with geom_violin(). Let’s start with a basic version.
```{r fig.keep='none'}
ggplot(df, aes(x = SEX, y = AGE)) + geom_boxplot()  #  Create basic boxplot 
ggplot(df, aes(x = SEX, y = AGE)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_grid(DRG ~ .)  # Figure 6.6A
ggplot(df, aes(x = SEX, y = AGE)) + geom_violin() + facet_grid(DRG ~ .)  # Figure 6.6B
```

The violin plot reveals more details about the distribution. Essentially, violin plot is like a boxplot showing density plot's elegance on either side of the "violin". 

Time to compose your own visual masterpiece:

```

       labs(x = "DRG groups", y = "Length of Stay(days)") + ylim(0, 20)  # Figure 6.6C
```

## Bar plot with error bars
Curious whether patients with certain diagnosis codes stay longer or shorter in the hospital after a heart attack? We could, of course, use the aggregate function to generate a table with mean LOS by diagnosis category.
```{r warning=FALSE}
aggregate(df, by = list(df$DIAGNOSIS), FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We may be happy with this table and call it quits. However, tables are often not easy to interpret compared with well-crafted graphs. Instead of the aggregate function, we can use the powerful dplyr package to summarize the data and then to generate a bar plot showing both the means and standard errors.  I've borrowed some nifty codes and ideas from R graphics cookbook and this informative website: [http://environmentalcomputing.net/plotting-with-ggplot-bar-plots-with-error-bars/](http://environmentalcomputing.net/plotting-with-ggplot-bar-plots-with-error-bars/).

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  # Load the package
```

To summarize data by groups/factors, the dplyr package uses a ggplot2-like grammar, where operations flow step by step. Similar to pipes in Unix, commands separated by “%>%” are executed sequentially where the output of one step becomes the input of the next. The follow 6 lines form one command, consisting of three major steps.
```{r}
stats <- df %>%  # Name the new data frame and source data frame
  group_by(DIAGNOSIS) %>%  # Group by diagnosis
  summarise(mean = mean(LOS),  # Calculate group means
            sd   = sd(LOS),    # And standard deviation of each group
            n    = n(),        # Count sample size per group
            se   = sd(LOS) / sqrt(n()))  # Compute standard error of each group
```

Here is a detailed summary by DIAGNOSIS:
```{r}
stats
```
Now let's bring these statistics to life with ggplot2 (Figure \@ref(fig:15-7)):

(ref:15-7) Average LOS by DIAGNOSIS group with error bars representing standard error.

```{r 15-7, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='(ref:15-7)', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(stats, aes(x = DIAGNOSIS, y = mean)) +   # Data & aesthetic mapping
	     geom_bar(stat = "identity") +            # Bars represent average
	     geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se), width = 0.2)  # Add error bars
```

Notice how we define error bars with the mean-se and mean+se referring to the two columns in the "stats" data frame. Because we have an extremely large sample size, the standard errors are relatively small. Interestingly, patients with a diagnosis of 41031 stay shorter in the hospital. A peek at the IDC code in [http://www.nuemd.com](http://www.nuemd.com) tells us this code represents “Acute myocardial infarction of inferoposterior wall, initial episode of care”, which probably makes sense.

As we did previously, now let's define the LOS bars for men and women separately. First, we need to fresh stats and generate different summary statistics.
```{r message=FALSE}
stats2 <- df %>% 
  group_by(DIAGNOSIS, SEX) %>%   # Group by both diagnosis and sex
  summarise(mean = mean(LOS),  
            sd   = sd(LOS), 
            n    = n(),  
            se   = sd(LOS) / sqrt(n())) 
```

The entire dataset is now divided into 18 groups according to all possible combinations of DIAGNOSIS and SEX. Each group's LOS is summarized in terms of mean, standard deviation (sd), observations (n), and standard errors(se). Here's the summarized data frame:
```{r}
stats2
```

Now we are ready to generate bar plot for men and women separately using the fill aesthetic mapping:

(ref:15-8) The length of stay summarized by diagnosis and sex. Error bars represent standard error.

```{r 15-8, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='(ref:15-8)', fig.align='center'}
ggplot(stats2, aes(x = DIAGNOSIS, y = mean, fill = SEX)) +  # Map the aesthetics
       geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +    # Plot bars for mean of LOS
       labs(x = "Diagnosis codes", y = "Length of Stay") +  # Label axes
       geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),  # Add error bars
       position = position_dodge(.9), width = 0.2)
```

(ref:15-9) Mean ages for patients with different diagnosis and treatment outcome.

```{r 15-9, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.cap='(ref:15-9)', fig.align='center'}
stats3 <- df %>% 
  group_by(DIAGNOSIS, DRG) %>%   # Group by both diagnosis and sex
  summarise(mean = mean(AGE),  
            sd   = sd(AGE), 
            n    = n(),  
            se   = sd(AGE) / sqrt(n())) 
ggplot(stats3, aes(x = DIAGNOSIS, y = mean, fill = DRG)) +       # Map the aesthetics
       geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +         # Plot bars 
       labs(x = "Diagnosis codes", y = "Age(yrs)") +             # Label axes
       geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean - se, ymax = mean + se),    # Add error bars
                     position = position_dodge(.9), width = 0.2)
```

```

Overall, our investigation uncovers that women are much older than men when admitted to hospital for heart attack, facing higher mortality and complication rates. It is not because they develop heart attack later in life, but their symptoms are subtler and often more easily get ignored. Remember, a heart attack might not always scream through chest pain; it could sometimes masquerade as back pain, numbness in the arm, or pain in the jaw or teeth! (Warning: Statistics professor is talking about medicine!)

As you could see from these plots, **ggplot2** generates attractive, publication-ready graphics. Moreover, it is a relatively structured way of customizing plots. That's why it is becoming popular among R users. 
Once again, there are many example codes and answered R coding questions online. Whatever you want to do, you can **google it, try the example code**, and modify it to fit your needs. Remember, Google is your friend for codes and solutions. And it's all free! Enjoy coding!

## Statistical models: Easy to Run, tricky to interpret!
Navigating the complex world of statistical models is like solving a mystery – running the code is straightforward, but interpreting and verifying the results requires a detective's eye!

By using pair-wised correlation analysis, here is a key finding: Women experience a higher mortality rate than men from heart attack, and tend to be older than men. However, this straightforward observation masks underlying confounding effects.
To unravel the mystery, we need to **delineate the effects of multiple factors using multiple linear regression**.  

Here’s how we model the hospital charges as a function of all other factors:  
```{r}
fit <- lm(CHARGES ~ SEX + LOS + AGE + DRG + DIAGNOSIS, data = df)
summary(fit) 
```

In this model, one reference level for each factor(such as female) is used as a baseline for comparison, so it does not display. Interestingly, being male (SEXM), shows a marginally significant effect on charges; In detail, if everything else being equal, a male patient will incur $183 dollars more cost than female for the hospital stay. It is really small number compared to overall charges and also the p value is just marginally significant for this large sample(0.02956). However, this finding is in contrast to the **t.test(CHARGES ~ SEX)** shown below, where we got the opposite conclusion with much smaller p value of 4.573e-07. It is because the t-test did not account for other factors, while the regression model did. 

```{r}
t.test(CHARGES ~ SEX, data = df)
```

Returning to our multiple linear regression model we can see that the most pronounced effect is LOS. This is not surprising, as many hospitals have charges on daily basis. Since the p values are cutoff at 2e-16, the **t value** is an indicator of significance.  LOS has a t value of 119.7, which is way bigger than that for all other variables. If I am an insurance company CEO, I will do anything I can to push the hospitals to discharge patients as early as possible. The coefficient tells us, for the average patient, one extra day of stay in the hospital increases the charges by 989.7 dollars. Surprisingly, age has a negative effect. Which means, when other factors are controlled, older patients are actually charged less. Good news for the older demographic - there is no reason to charge older patients more in terms of insurance premiums. Also, there is a little evidence in gender differences in charges. Compared with patients who had complications (DRG = 121, the baseline), those have no complications (DRG = 122) incurred less charges on average by the amount of $916. Sadly, patients who died(DRG = 123) are likely to be charged more. Diagnosis codes also play a role: patients with diagnosis codes 41091, 41051 and 41071 incurred less charges compared with those with 41001.  

Now let's investigate mortality. It is a binary outcome, so we turn to **logistic regression**.  
```{r}
fit <- glm(DIED ~ SEX + LOS + AGE + DIAGNOSIS, family = binomial( ), data = df)
summary(fit)
```

Note that DIED is coded 1 for patients died, and 0 for survivors. A negative coefficient indicates less likely to die, hence more likely to survive. Males are more likely to survive heart attack, compared with females with the same age and diagnosis. patients with longer hospital stay have better survival chances, while older patients are more likely to die. Compared with patients with diagnosis code of 41001, those diagnosed with 41071, 41041, and 41091, are more likely to survive.

Now, it's your turn to explore the factors influencing length of stay:

>
```{exercise}

>
Use multiple linear regression to investigate the factors affecting length of stay(LOS), excluding charges. Interpret your results.
>
fit <- ___________(LOS ~ SEX + AGE + DRG + DIAGNOSIS, data = ___________)
>
___________(fit) 
```

While not part of the exercise, another query we may interested in is identifying factors contributing to complications in surviving patients. Her, focusing only on the survivors and using logistic regression would be the way to go. 

Remember, pair-wise examinations are crucial; including two highly correlated factors in the same model is a statistical faux pas. Happy data deciphering!
