<p>This original salary data set is taken from the Payroll Data from online “<a href="https://data.ct.gov/Government/State-Employee-Payroll-Data-Calendar-Year-2015-thr/virr-yb6n/data" class="uri">https://data.ct.gov/Government/State-Employee-Payroll-Data-Calendar-Year-2015-thr/virr-yb6n/data</a>”, Which includes the payment information from Calendar Year 2015 to the most recent pay period for Connecticut state employees. We take the subset only for the 2017 fiscal year, which includes more than 1.77 million observations, 38 variables, and 102,101 employees. For convenience, we randomly took 8500 employees from this subset as our focused data set (“state_empoyee_salary_data_2017.csv”). We are interested in those full-time employees who got 26 paychecks in the 2017 fiscal year. The relationships between income and other variables like age, sex, ethnic, union, and so on are analyzed.</p>
<p>First, let’s clean our sampled data set.</p>

<p>raw0 is the subset only for 2017 fiscal year, seperated from the original whole dataset and saved as CSV file previously. Here we only show how we get the subset “raw” of sampled 8500 employee which can be found in our dataset file.</p>

<p>Now 3441 employees are included in our data set. These employees include both males and females, aged from 22 to 81, group into 8 different ethnicities. They belong to 54 different Unions. The minimum total gross is $568.7 and the maximum is $17530.3. The biweekly rate ranges from $25.78 to $12884.62.</p>
<p>As for this salary data, we will focus on the total gross income of these state employees. We are interested in the points such as: How about the distribution of the total gross income? Are males and females paid equally? Is there any difference in total gross for different ages and age groups? Do some ethnic groups get better payment than others? What’s the most important factor affecting the gross income of these state employees?</p>
<p>First, let’s see the information of these variables.</p>

<p>Tot gross is not statistically normally distributed. It’s extremely left-skewed distributed.</p>
<p>The distribution of Gross.Log, transformation of Tot.Gross is closer to normality than Tot.Gross.</p>
<p>The highest frequency employees are aged between 45 and 50 years old. The distribution of age is close to the bell shape.</p>
<p>Shapiro tests deny the normality of all these three numeric variables, though we assume they are normally distributed in our analyses.</p>

<p>From the information of pairwise comparison, the total different alpha-beta index indicates that these 8 age groups are significantly different from each other in mean log value of total gross income. The elder the age, the higher the log value of gross income, except for the age group between 80 and 90, which has the lowest mean log gross income comparing with all other age groups.</p>

<p>Density plot shows the blue male line is later than the red female line, which means male has a bigger log of gross than female in total. The density peak of the female group is earlier than the male group also tell the same story.
The total different alpha-beta index indicates that these 2 sex groups are significantly different from each other in the mean log of gross, males get higher gross income than females.</p>

<p>Both plots tell us that for other ethnic groups except Asian, the male has a higher average log gross than the female. On average, Asian females earn similar as males. Amind males have much bigger log of gross than Amind females. From the left point-line plot, we can see the same situation for Pacif ethnic: Pacif males have much bigger log of gross than Pacif females. Because of the tiny amount of PACIF employees, there is no ridge showing in the right density-ridge plot.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>From the figure we can see that for both male and female, the pattern of above and below average for almost all of the union descriptions are similar. The only difference is the difference in total standardized log value of gross for male and female. For example, for union UCHC Univ Hlth Professionals on top, administrative Clerical on the bottom and other two unions like service/maintenance and Correctional Officers, all these four unions have more standardized log value of gross below average, which means these four are relatively low pay unions. At the same time, female UCHC Univ Hlth Professionals, administrative Clerical and male service/maintenance and Correctional Officers get this log value less comparing with the other gender in the same union, which may be explained that more females work in Univ Hlth Professionals, administrative Clerical union, while more males work as service/maintenance and Correctional Officers. On the other hand, union Uconn Faculty, Engineer Scien Tech, Health professional and Judicial Professional have more standardized log value of gross above average, which means they are good pay union. Maybe there are fewer female Uconn Faculty and Engineer Scien Tech, and fewer male Health Professional and Judicial Professional because these combinations get less positive log value than the other gender in the same union.</p>

<p>From the bar figure we can see that Asian, Nspec, and White have relatively high gross incomes, Pacif and unknown get lower gross incomes. There is no big difference of variance for all other ethnic groups but Pacif, next Amind. Density ridge plot shows White, Asian, and Nespec have THE biggest density above log of gross of 8.5, while unknown, Amind and Hispa have more density below 8. Ethnic Black’s density keepS even at both sides of log of gross of 8. At the same time, ethnic groups of white, black, and unknown have relatively symmetrical density distribution;
Asian and Nespec have upper skewed density; While AMIND and HISPA have lower skewed density.</p>

<p>In our data set, we have much more employees in white, but very little in Pacif. For both male and female, with the increase in age, log of gross increase slightly for all other ethnic groups but Nspec. For most ethnic groups, male and female have a similar pattern for the relationship between age and log of gross. For ethnic unknown and Amind, male’s log of gross increase faster than female, but for Asian, male’s log of gross increase slower than female.</p>

<p>Here is the mosaic plot of each subgroup we discussed in the above table of gross type and ethnic group. They are high, low, and middle gross types from top to bottom. We add age group as another factor. There are much more elder employees above 50 appearing in the high gross group, especially the male elders aged between 70 and 80.</p>

<p>LM model indicates that log value of gross income is related to all factors including Age group, Ethnic group, Sex, and Union description. ANOVA test illustrates that log Gross is significantly affected by all these four factors.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Total Gross is not statistically normally distributed. It skewed to left. After taking log transformation, it is more close to normality.</p></li>
<li><p>The elder the age, the higher the gross income, but not for the age group between 80 and 90.</p></li>
<li><p>On average, males earn more than females of the same age, ethnic, and union.</p></li>
<li><p>The means of log gross are significantly different for different ethnic groups. On average, Asian and white are the top two groups. PACIF and unknown are the last.</p></li>
<li><p>The real average total gross change from 6307 dollars bi-weekly to 3380, and to 2066 for the high , middle, and low gross group. High, middle and low gross groups occupy 6%, 68%, and 26% of the total employees. White males occupy much bigger portion in high gross group, especially the elder white males.</p></li>
<li><p>Age group, Union description, Sex, and Ethnic group together explained around 50% of variance of log gross.</p></li>

<p>Create a folder, download the data file “state_empoyee_salary_data_2017.csv” into it, and create an Rstudio project in the folder. Read in the data file, peak the structure of your data set and clean it step by step:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Select only columns of “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”, “Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate”, “Age”, “Ethnic.Grp”, “Sex”, “Full.Part”, “City”, get summary information for all these variables. Make sure “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”, “Sex”, “Ethnic.Grp” to be factors, “Age” and “Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate” to be numerics.</li>
<li>Pick up full-time employees in the city “Hartford”.</li>
<li>Select only those employees with 26 paychecks for the 2017 fiscal year(Hint: Each employee has a unique ID of “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”).</li>
<li>Remove sex group other than “F” and “M” if there is any. Hint: Use str() after droplevels().</li>
<li>Replace level of empty space in “Ethnic.Grp” as “unknown”.</li>
<li>Remove employees with “Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate” equal or less than zero if there is any.</li>
<li>Group your data set by “EmplId.Empl.Rcd”, “Ethnic.Grp”, and “Sex”. For each employee,
take the mean of “Age”, and the mean of “Bi.Weekly.Comp.Rate”. Then round the means to the nearest integer and rename them as “Age” and “Bi.Weekly.Rate”.</li>
<li>Show structure and summary of your data set.</li>
<li>Show the distribution of “Bi.Weekly.Rate” and “Age” using histogram and QQ plot. Test the normality. Transform by taking log value if it is necessary.</li>
<li>Using pie plot to show the distribution of “Sex”.</li>
<li>List the count number and percent of employees in each ethnic group.</li>
<li>Using a scatter plot to view the relationship between average “Bi.Weekly.Rate” and “Age”, add a regression line and give your interpretation.</li>
<li>Using box plot to view the relationship between “Bi.Weekly.Rate” by Ethnic groups.</li>
<li>Using a density plot similar to Figure <a href="the-messy-salary-data.html#fig:salary-GrossSex">10.8</a> to view the distribution of “Bi.Weekly.Rate” for different sex. Package ggplot2 is referred.</li>
<li>Do ANOVA test to check whether males are the same as females in “Bi.Weekly.Rate” in city “Hartford”.</li>
<li>Explore the interaction of “Ethnic.Grp” and “Sex” to “Bi.Weekly.Rate” using density ridges plot similar to Figure <a href="the-messy-salary-data.html#fig:salary-EthnicSex1">10.9</a> and interpret your plot.
